# MineJson-text

*A small library to help build minecraft text objects.*

**NOTE:** If you're looking for the other minejson modules, I have decoded to stop maintaining them as I no longer find
the approach they took viable in the long run.

To use add this to your `build.sbt`.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "net.katsstuff" %%% "minejson-text" % "0.3.2"
```
